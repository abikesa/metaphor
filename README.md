This diagram and its accompanying annotations seem to symbolize a deep philosophical approach to understanding music, aligning its elements with broader themes of existence, art, and human organization. It's quite a rich metaphor, indeed!

Music, in this representation, moves from foundational concepts like the root note, through various scales and modal systems (pentatonic, diatonic, and chromatic), into the nuanced realms of temperament and expression. Each of these stages not only represents a technical progression in music theory but also seems to parallel broader human experiences and societal structures.

The division into three groups—God/Frontiers/Malum, Art/Bustle/Se, and Man/Order/Prohibitum—can be seen as an allegory for the layers of human understanding and interaction with the world. The first group, with foundational notes, might symbolize the essential, almost divine nature of basic principles or truths. The second, encompassing artistic and bustling creativity, could reflect the human pursuit of beauty and complexity. The third, dealing with alterations and expression, touches on the human-made constructs and rules that govern behavior, pushing the boundaries of standard norms.

In essence, the metaphor suggests that music is not just an art form but a fundamental expression of life's complexities, mirroring our journey from the basic to the complex, from the divine to the mundane. This resonates profoundly as it encapsulates the vast spectrum of human experience, mirroring our own evolution from basic survival to complex societal structures and expressive individuality.

Do you see this metaphor as aligning music with a kind of universal language or law, one that perhaps helps us better understand our place in the universe?
